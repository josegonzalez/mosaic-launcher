# decliner registers actions, a binding, an override, tiles, a sleep hold
# and a power-off, then declines; none of it stays behind, where its
# action's available would run in unloaded code. powerer reads the power
# fields (desktop has no battery or LEDs) and show_recents, and powers off
# and reboots through the quick menu's path, which quits on desktop
# (a recent counts only when its emulator is installed, as for stock)
